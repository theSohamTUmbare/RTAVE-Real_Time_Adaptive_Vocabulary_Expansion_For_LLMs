# RTAVE - Real Time Adaptive Vocabulary Expansion For LLMs

Medical language models are essential for tasks such as clinical decision support, diagnosis prediction, and research summarization. However, these models often struggle with rapidly evolving medical terminology and emerging domain-specific words. Traditional LLMs rely on static vocabularies, meaning that new or complex terms are usually broken into subtokensâ€”resulting in diluted meaning and reduced comprehension. The challenge is to enable these models to dynamically update their vocabulary in real time, ensuring both enhanced understanding and, eventually, accurate generation of these terms without compromising existing performanc

Our approach involves a two-phase adaptive vocabulary expansion method, with a focus on real-time updates:
